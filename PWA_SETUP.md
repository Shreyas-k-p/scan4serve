- `/public/icon-512.png` (512x512 pixels)

### Quick Icon Creation

1. Use any image editor (Photoshop, GIMP, Canva)

2. Serve with HTTPS (required for PWA):
   ```bash
   npx serve -s dist
   ```
3. Open in browser
4. Check "Application" tab in DevTools
5. Look for "Install" button in address bar

## 📝 Notes

- Service Worker only works on HTTPS (or localhost)
- Icons are optional but recommended
- App will work without icons, but won't be installable on some devices
